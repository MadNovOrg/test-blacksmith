name: RELEASE PROD VERSION

# This workflow is designed to be run after the changesets PR has been closed and
# merged. It should not run for any other PR closure, and should not run if the changesets
# PR is closed and dismissed without merging. This workflow fetches the version number
# in package.json and creates a tag using it, then creates a release using that tag. This
# release should then trigger `cd-prod.yml`
